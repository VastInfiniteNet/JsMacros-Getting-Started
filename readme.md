# Welcome
Hello there! The goal of this document is to teach one how to setup JS Macros Mod. 

This setup is targeted towards users: 
- using MultiMC, but similar principles *should* apply to other Minecraft launchers.
- running Minecraft 1.18.2, but same principles *should* apply to other Minecraft versions.


If you already have JS Macros installed, and looking for instructions on how to run a script you downloaded, go to the "Running a script" section.

# Getting Started
1. Open MultiMC!
    - If you haven't already, sign in into your minecraft account.
    - Similarly, make a new instance if you are using an existing one.


1. Install Fabric mod loader.

    1. Select instance and click `Edit Instance` on the righthand side.
    1. Select `Install Fabric`; select the most recent version, and click `OK`.
        - you should now see `Intermediary Mappings` and `Fabric Loader` in the Version list. Make sure both are checked off.
        Should look similar to: ![Image of Version list](https://pomf2.lain.la/f/n6ynseve.png)


1. Install Fabric API.

    1. Go to the [Fabric API mod page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) and download the most recent version for the game version you are playing on. For 1.18.2: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/3891301.
    1. Now select `Loader mods` and the lefthand side, below `Version`, and click `Add` on the righthand side.
    1. Navigate to where you downloaded the Fabric API zip to, and select and open it.
        - You should now see `Fabric API` in the mod list.
        If this your first mod installed for the instance, the `Loader mods` list should look like: ![Image of Loader mods list](https://pomf2.lain.la/f/szt6ou1.png)


1. Install JS Macros.

    1. Go to the [JS Macros mod page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jsmacros/files) and download the most recent version for the game version you are playing on. Make sure it is the fabric verison! file name should look like `jsmacros-1.XX.X-FABRIC-X.X.X.jar`.
    For 1.18.2: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jsmacros/files/3904779.
    1. Now add the mod. Click `Add` on the righthand side.
    1. Navigate to where you downloaded the Js Macros zip to, and select and open it.
        - You should now see `Fabric API` in the mod list.
        If this your first mod installed for the instance, the `Loader mods` list should look like: ![Image of Loader mods list](https://pomf2.lain.la/f/5dmxfjvr.png)
